•	We will be creating a web application to show campus events and manage ticket purchasing. This will be to increase student engagement and help them learn about, plan and attend the events on or around campus. The main functionality of this application will be to allow browsing of events, save events the student is interested in, prchace or claim tickets and generate QR codes to check in at the event. 
•	There will be three account types: Administrator, which deals with moderation and oversees organizations. Organization accounts, which can create and manage events, track attendsnce and view analytics. User accounts, which will hold past event data and hold a point system for discounts or pormotions when they accumulate enough.

•	You are implementing a Campus Events & Ticketing Web Application designed to help students discover, organize, and attend events on campus. The system enables students to browse events, save them, claim free or paid tickets, and check in using QR codes. Organizers can create and manage events, track attendance, and access analytics through dashboards, while administrators moderate content and oversee organizations. The application streamlines event management, improves student engagement, and provides valuable insights for both organizers and campus administration.
